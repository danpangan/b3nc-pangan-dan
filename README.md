### Getting started with GitLab
This is my first feedback.

### List, Tables, Forms Formatting
Appreciated the way of teaching technical matters using non-technical words.  

nice to know about the proper way of naming html elemnts, but I think it's better to introduce naming conventions (Camel back notation/Camel case) properly as early as possible to reduce conflicts and improve sync on later topics :)

### Updating of remote repo using gitlab
Instructions are well given, didn't have a hard time figuring what to do.
